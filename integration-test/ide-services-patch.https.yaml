## This configuration file is for IDE Services to use OAuth2-bro in dual HTTP/HTTPS mode
## - login-url uses HTTPS (for browser redirects)
## - token-url uses HTTP (for backend communication)
## - jwt-certs-url uses HTTP (for backend communication)
##
## This setup solves the problem of configuring HTTPS certificates between services
## by using HTTP for internal service-to-service communication while maintaining
## HTTPS for external browser access.

tbe:
  auth:
    # Browser redirects use HTTPS (external port 8443)
